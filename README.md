# Project 6 - *Translate Me*

Submitted by: **Topu Sahae**

**Translate Me** is an app that translates words/sentences to different languages. 

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [X] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [X] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [X] The history of translations can be erased
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [ ] Add UI flair

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

One thing I had difficulties with is making sure everything is running on the propper thread. Another thing that I have to troubleshoot is inspecting why the API is not working properly. It is not able to translate for all words.
